### Experience in Java
- I have more than 3 years experience in Java
- I mainly use SpringMVC framework in my former jobs, and I started using Springboot during my masters.

### What I've done
- Made project working as expected
    - Installed [Lombok](https://medium.com/danielpadua/java-lombok-2984afff3e0a)  first as the original project was using it.
    - Fixed the employee saving bug (wrong logic in controller and should not write logic in controller) `[1]`

- Request / Response / REST API
    - Added the paging query method, as an interface that can return all the data is not a wise choice. `[1][11][15]`
    - Standardized the return value wrapping with Result.class to make it easy to be called and parsed by each end.`[1][13][14]`
    - Added some API desc to REST methods (Increase the readability of Swagger) `[1]`
    - Added request models instead of EntityBean at controller `[1][12]`
    - Exception handling `[9][10]`

- Protect controller end points
    - Authentication using spring security and Secure REST Controllers `[6][7]`
    - Database Authentication - User Repository and User Details Service `[3][5][8]`
    
- Add caching logic for database calls
    - Added caching logic for database calls in service layer.`[11]`
    
- Improve doc and comments
    
- Added tests
    - Added tests for EmployeeService `[21]`
    - Checked if the cache is in effect by enabling database access logging.`[19]`
    
- Init datasets `[18]`

### What can be improved If I had more time?
- Logging system - ELK(ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Considering scalability, use Redis or Memcache to replace the existing caching solution.
- Some common methods like searching employees by name, we can use search engines like ElasticSearch.
- Containerizing our SpringBoot application, so we can code and test locally while ensuring consistency between development and production.


### How to use this spring-boot project

- Install packages with `mvn package`
- Run `mvn spring-boot:run` for starting the application (or use your IDE)

Application (with the embedded H2 database) is ready to be used ! You can access the url below for testing it :

- Swagger UI : http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
- H2 UI : http://localhost:8080/h2-console
- Initialized two employee data for easy testing, please refer to: classpath:db/data.sql
- Initialized two user information for authentication (username : password):
    - admin : admin
    - user : user

> Don't forget to set the `JDBC URL` value as `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb` for H2 UI.
